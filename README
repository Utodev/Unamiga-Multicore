This code updates the UnAmiga multicore firmware and core. The code is based in a similar system 
used by Victor Trucco's in his Multicore board, and is completely based on his code.

Please notice Victor's code also comes from other authors work, so please feel free to ask for credit
if you are one of the original designers of this multicore idea.

Some changes have been made though:

- You can press F1-F10 when over a core in the menu, and that specific key is assigned to that core
- Once assigned, when you press that key the core is launched
- If you want to remove key assignation, just move the cursor over the core and press "Del" key
